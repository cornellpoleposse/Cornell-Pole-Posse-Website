  <h2>History</h2>
  <p class="history"> Cornell Pole Posse is Cornell University's pole dancing club, and the first pole dancing club in the Ivy League. Risley Residential College is the home of Pole Posse. Back in 2004, Cornell's first pole was approved for purchase by the Risley Kommittee. Before the approval, there was controversy surrounding the purchase because of the stigma around pole dancing. Many were concerned that the purchase of a pole could be associated with indecent behavior. However, the stigma surrounding pole dancing was overlooked, and the importance of viewing it as another artform prevailed. </p>
