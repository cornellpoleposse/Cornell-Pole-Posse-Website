    <td class="peopole">Hey everyone! I’m a first year senior in the college of Arts & Sciences majoring in Economics with minors in English and Law & Society. I’m fairly new to the pole dancing scene, having started just a few months ago, but I quickly fell in love with the rigor and creativity of it.  When not on a pole, you can find me taking part in other clubs like Outdoor Odyssey or the Esports club, practicing with my Germanic longsword, or reading a book in a tree somewhere.</td>
